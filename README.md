Projects relating to Latin:

* parsing-latin-hexameter-with-combinators is a parser combinator library I wrote (as a learning experience - not good code) to parse Latin hexameter.
* resultativity-in-Latin is my undergraduate thesis, analysing Latin "proleptic" constructions as resultatives (e.g. "sing oneself hoarse")
